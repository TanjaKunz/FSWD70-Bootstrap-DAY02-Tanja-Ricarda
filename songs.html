		<h3>Mamma Mia!</h3>
		<h5>ABBA</h5>
		<p>
			I been cheated by you since you know when<br>
			So I made up my mind, it must come to an end<br>
			Look at me now, will I ever learn?<br>
			I don't know how but I suddenly lose control<br>
			There's a fire within my soul<br>
			Just one look and I can hear a bell ring<br>
			One more look and I forget everything
		</p>
		<p>
			Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
			My my, how can I resist you?<br>
			Mamma mia, does it show again<br>
			My my, just how much I've missed you?<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
			Blue since the day we parted<br>
			Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>
			Mamma mia, now I really know<br>
			My my, I could never let you go<br>
			I've been angry and sad about things that you do<br>
			I can't count all the times that I've told you "we're through"<br>
			And when you go, when you slam the door<br>
			I think you know that you won't be away too long<br>
			You know that I'm not that strong<br>
			Just one look and I can hear a bell ring<br>
			One more look and I forget everything
		</p>
		<p>
			Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
			My my, how can I resist you?<br>
			Mamma mia, does it show again<br>
			My my, just how much I've missed you?
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
			Blue since the day we parted<br>
			Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>
			Mamma mia, even if I say<br>
			"Bye bye, leave me now or never"<br>
			Mamma mia, it's a game we play<br>
			"Bye bye" doesn't mean forever
		</p>
		<p>
			Mamma mia, here I go again<br>
			My my, how can I resist you?<br>
			Mamma mia, does it show again<br>
			My my, just how much I've missed you?
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, I've been brokenhearted<br>
			Blue since the day we parted<br>
			Why, why did I ever let you go?<br>

			My my, I could never let you go

		<h3>Dancing Queen</h3>
		<h5>ABBA</h5>
		<p>
			Ooh<br>
			You can dance<br>
			You can jive<br>
			Having the time of your life<br>
			Ooh, see that girl<br>
			Watch that scene<br>
			Dig in the dancing queen<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Friday night and the lights are low<br>
			Looking out for a place to go<br>
			Where they play the right music<br>
			Getting in the swing<br>
			You come to look for a king<br>
			Anybody could be that guy<br>
			Night is young and the music's high<br>
			With a bit of rock music<br>
			Everything is fine<br>
			You're in the mood for a dance<br>
			And when you get the chance
		</p>
		<p>
			You are the dancing queen<br>
			Young and sweet<br>
			Only seventeen<br>
			Dancing queen<br>
			Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah<br>
			You can dance<br>
			You can jive<br>
			Having the time of your life<br>
			Ooh, see that girl<br>
			Watch that scene<br>
			Dig in the dancing queen
		</p>
		<p>
			You're a teaser, you turn 'em on<br>
			Leave 'em burning and then you're gone<br>
			Looking out for another<br>
			Anyone will do<br>
			You're in the mood for a dance<br>
			And when you get the chance
		</p>
		<p>
			You are the dancing queen<br>
			Young and sweet<br>
			Only seventeen<br>
			Dancing queen<br>
			Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah<br>
			You can dance<br>
			You can jive<br>
			Having the time of your life<br>
			Ooh, see that girl<br>
			Watch that scene<br>
			Dig in the dancing queen<br>
			Dig in the dancing queen
